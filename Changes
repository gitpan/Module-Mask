Module::Mask changes document

0.05 - Fri Dec 14 2012
    - Stop trying to match perl's native error message, it's about to change
      in a way which won't be trivial to continue to support with backwards
      compatibility.

      Users who need the error message to match can override the message()
      method to match their perl.

    - Cope with Carp sometimes adding a full-stop to error messages.

      is masked.
